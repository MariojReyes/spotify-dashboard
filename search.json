Interacting with multiple apis, ingesting, cleaning, analyzing real-time data. \nThe first page of this dashboard was inspired by Melissa Van Bussel’s 2024 Posit Table Contest submission, which served as a template and educational reference.\nThe current version includes a lightweight data pipeline that refreshes Spotify Hot 100 track data, manages cache files for weekly updates, and enriches chart tracks with audio features for analysis-ready outputs. Second page will be added soon, and will include a more in depth analysis of the audio features of the tracks, as well as some visualizations. Taking a look at how music has evolved over time, and how the audio features of the tracks have changed over time.\nIf you’d like to connect, you can find me here:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/MariojReyes\n\nLinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/marioreyesiii\n\n\n\n\n\n::::::",
