# Hi, I'm Mario

### Welcome to my project!

This dashboard is part of a personal learning end to end analytics project. Interacting with multiple apis, ingesting, cleaning, analyzing real-time data.\ 

The first page of this dashboard was inspired by **Melissa Van Bussel’s 2024 Posit Table Contest submission**, which served as a template and educational reference.

The current version includes a lightweight data pipeline that refreshes Spotify Hot 100 track data, manages cache files for weekly updates, and enriches chart tracks with audio features for analysis-ready outputs. Second page will be added soon, and will include a more in depth analysis of the audio features of the tracks, as well as some visualizations. Taking a look at how music has evolved over time, and how the audio features of the tracks have changed over time.
