# Hi, I'm Mario

### Welcome to my project!

This dashboard is part of a personal learning exercise where I explore R, Quarto, reproducible workflows, and interactive data products.\
It was inspired by **Melissa Van Bussel’s 2024 Posit Table Contest submission**, which served as a template and educational reference.

The current version includes a lightweight data pipeline that refreshes Spotify Hot 100 track data, manages cache files for weekly updates, and enriches chart tracks with audio features for analysis-ready outputs.

I'm currently building skills in data analysis and engineering—including SQL, Python, R, API work, and dashboard development. I enjoy creating small analytical tools and exploring real datasets, especially music, sports, and personal metrics.
